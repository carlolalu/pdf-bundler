## Problem

I want to reorganise my whole university library more properly. To do that I sometimes need to unite numerous pdf files all together (e.g. my homeworks for GIP or my notes of SDEs). 

<img src="./images/notes-SDEs.png" alt="Example: this is the folder of the official SDEs notes of the course." height="350">

If there are many pdf files and I must do one single from all of them, I want to have a Table of Content (ToC) which shows me the position of the single individual file in the big pdf where the files are united together (extra: and possibly even an index in the beginning). If I do not have it, the file bundled together will become unuseful, because I will not know how to find informations quickly.

It would be good also to have the same idea, but with 2 or 3 levels of folders/files.

I also found that there is a command line tool which is more or less the opposite of what I am doing: https://github.com/einoko/pdf-toc-splitter
